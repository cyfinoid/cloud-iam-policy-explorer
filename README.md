# AWS Policy Explorer

## About

A client-side web application for exploring and analyzing AWS IAM policies with automated shadow admin detection. Built for security professionals to identify privilege escalation paths and assess IAM policy risks in real-time.

The tool features automated detection of 23+ privilege escalation methods, side-by-side policy version comparison, and visual risk scoring. All analysis happens directly in your browser - AWS credentials never leave your machine and are not stored anywhere.

## Credits

Shadow admin detection logic is based on research from the [**Pacu**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu) framework by Rhino Security Labs, specifically the `iam__privesc_scan` module by Spencer Gietzen.

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools, most notably **Cursor IDE**, **Claude Code**, and **Qwen3-Coder**. These tools helped accelerate development and improve velocity. All AI-generated code has been carefully reviewed and validated through human inspection to ensure it aligns with the project‚Äôs intended functionality and quality standards.
